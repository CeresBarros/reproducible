Title: A set of tools that enhance reproducibility beyond package management
Description: Built on top of 'git2r' and 'archivist', this package aims at
    making high-level, robust, machine and OS independent tools for making
    deeply reproducible and re-useable content in R. This extends beyond the
    package management utilites of 'packrat' and 'checkpoint' by including tools
    for caching and accessing GitHub repositories.
