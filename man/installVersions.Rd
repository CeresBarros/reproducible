\usage{
installVersions(gitHubPackages, packageVersionFile = ".packageVersions.txt",
  libPath = .libPaths()[1], notOlderThan = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gitHubPackages}{Character vectors indicating repository/packageName@branch}

\item{packageVersionFile}{Path to the package version file, defaults to
the \code{.packageVersions.txt}.}

\item{libPath}{The library path where all packages should be installed, and looked for to load
(i.e., call \code{library})}

\item{notOlderThan}{load an artifact from the database only if it was created after notOlderThan.}
}
\description{
This uses CRAN, CRAN archives, or MRAN (accessed via \code{versions::install.versions})
for remote repositories.
This will attempt to install all packages in the \code{packageVersionFile},
with their exact version described in that file. For GitHub packages, it will
use \code{\link[devtools]{install_github}}
}
\details{
Because of potential conflicts with loaded packages, this function will run
\code{install.packages} in a separate R process.
