\description{
This is primarily useful for achieving repeatability with Caching.
Essentially, when Caching, it is likely that character strings should be
digested verbatim, i.e., it must be an exact copy for the Cache mechanism
to detect a candidate for recovery from the cache. Paths, are different. While
they are character strings, there are many ways to write the same path. Examples
of identical meaning, but different character strings are:
path exanding of ~ vs. not, double back slash vs. single forward slash, relative
path vs. absolute path. All of these should be assessed for their actual file or
directory location, NOT their character string. By converting all character
string that are actual file or directory paths with this function, then Cache
will correctly assess the location, NOT the charcter string representation.
