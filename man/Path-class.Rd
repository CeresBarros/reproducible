\description{
It is often difficult to impossible do know algorithmically whether a
character string is a valid path. In the case where it is en existing
file, \code{file.exists} can work. But if it is not yet existing, e.g.,
for a \code{save}, it is difficult to know if it is a valid path.
This allows a user to specify that their character string is indeed
a file path. Thus, methods that require only a file path can be
dispatched correctly.
