\usage{
recursiveRobustDigest(object, objects, compareRasterFileLength, algo)

digestRaster(object, compareRasterFileLength, algo)

getFunctionName(FUN, ..., overrideCall)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object to convert to a 'digestible' state}

\item{objects}{Optional character vector indicating which objects are to
be considered while making digestible.}

\item{compareRasterFileLength}{Numeric. Optional. When there are Rasters, that
have file-backed storage, this is passed to the length arg in \code{digest}
when determining if the Raster file is already in the database.
Note: uses \code{\link[digest]{digest}} for file-backed Raster.
Default 1e6. Passed to \code{prepareFileBackedRaster}.}

\item{algo}{The algorithms to be used; currently available choices are
    \code{md5}, which is also the default, \code{sha1}, \code{crc32},
    \code{sha256}, \code{sha512}, \code{xxhash32}, \code{xxhash64} and
    \code{murmur32}.}

\item{FUN}{A function}

\item{...}{passing the ... from outer function, which will include potential
arguments to the FUN}

\item{overrideCall}{A character string indicating a different (not "Cache") function
name to search for. Mostly so that this works with deprecated "cache".}
}
\description{
For reproducibility, there are many features or attributes of objects that must
be removed e.g., environments have unique labels, rasters have several infrequently
used slots and elements that are not perfectly maintained with manipulation.
These customDigest functions attempt to deal with some of the types of problems.
In conjunction with \code{\link{robustDigest}}, these are helpers to create
consisten cache results.

These are internal only.
