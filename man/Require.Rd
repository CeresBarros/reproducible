Require(packages, forceInstall = FALSE, ...)

\arguments{
\item{packages}{Character vector of packages to install via
\code{install.packages}, then load (i.e., with \code{library})}
}
\description{
This is an "all in one" function that will run \code{install.packages} for
CRAN packages and \code{devtools::install_github} for GitHub.com packages, plus
all their dependencies with \code{unique(dependencies)} so the same package is
not installed multiple times, and finally \code{library} is called on the
\code{packages}.
