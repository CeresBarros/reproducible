\arguments{
\item{packages}{Character vector of packages to install via
\code{install.packages}, then load (i.e., with \code{library})}

\item{packageVersionFile}{If provided, then this will override all \code{install.package}
calls with \code{versions::install.versions}}

\item{libPath}{The library path where all packages should be installed, and looked for to load
(i.e., call \code{library})}

\item{notOlderThan}{load an artifact from the database only if it was created after notOlderThan.}

\item{install_githubArgs}{List of optional named arguments, passed to install_github}

\item{install.packagesArgs}{List of optional named arguments, passed to install.packages}
}
\description{
This is an "all in one" function that will run \code{install.packages} for
CRAN packages, \code{devtools::install_github} for GitHub.com packages and
\code{versions::install.versions} if there is a \code{packageVersionFile} supplied.
Plus, when \code{packages} is provided as a character vector, or a
\code{packageVersionFile} is supplied, all package dependencies
will be first assessed for \code{unique(dependencies)} so the same package is
not installed multiple times. Finally \code{library} is called on the
\code{packages}. If packages are already installed (\code{packages} supplied),
and their version numbers are exact (when \code{packageVersionFile} is supplied),
then the "install" component will be skipped very quickly with a message.
}
\note{
This function will use \code{Cache} internally to determine the dependencies
of all \code{packages}. The cache repository will be inside the \code{libPath},
and will be named \code{.cache}. This will speed up subsequent calls to \code{Require}
dramatically.
It will not take into account version numbers for this
caching step. If package versions are updated manually by the user, then this cached
element should be wiped, using \code{notOlderThan = Sys.time()}.
