\usage{
pkgDepTopoSort(
  pkgs,
  deps,
  reverse = FALSE,
  topoSort = TRUE,
  useAllInSearch = FALSE,
  returnFull = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkgs}{A vector of package names to evaluate their
reverse depends (i.e., the packages that \emph{use} each
of these packages)}

\item{deps}{An optional named list of (reverse) dependencies.
If not supplied, then \code{tools::dependsOnPkgs(..., recursive = TRUE)}
will be used}

\item{reverse}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then this will use \code{tools::pkgDependsOn}
to determine which packages depend on the \code{pkgs}}

\item{topoSort}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the default, then
the returned list of packages will be in order with the
least number of dependencies listed in \code{pkgs} at
the top of the list.}

\item{useAllInSearch}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then all non-core
R packages in \code{search()} will be appended to \code{pkgs}
to allow those to also be identified}

\item{returnFull}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the full reverse
dependencies will be returned; if \code{FALSE}, the default,
only the reverse dependencies that are found within the \code{pkgs}
(and \code{search()} if \code{useAllInSearch = TRUE}) will be returned.}
}
\value{
A possibly ordered, named (with packages as names) list where list elements
are either full reverse depends.
}
\description{
This is a wrapper around \code{tools::dependsOnPkgs},
but with the added option of \code{sorted}, which
will sort them such that the packages at the top will have
the least number of dependencies that are in \code{pkgs}.
This is essentially a topological sort, but it is done
heuristically. This can be used to e.g., \code{detach} or
\code{unloadNamespace} packages in order so that they each
of their dependencies are detached or unloaded first.
