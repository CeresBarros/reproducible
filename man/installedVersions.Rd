\title{Determine versions all installed pacakges}
\usage{
installedVersions(packages, libPath)
}
\arguments{
\item{packages}{Character vector of packages to determine which version is installed in the \code{libPath}.}

\item{libPath}{The library path where all packages should be installed, and looked for to load
(i.e., call \code{library})}
}
\description{
This code is taken very directly from the \code{installed.versions} function in the
\code{versions} package, but uses an \code{Rcpp} alternative
to readLines for speed. It will be anywhere from 2x to 10x faster than the \code{installed.versions}
\code{versions} function. This is also many times faster (1000x ? for the 1 package
case) than \code{utils::installed.packages}
especially if only a subset of "all" packages in libPath are desired.

installedVersions("reproducible", .libPaths()[1])
