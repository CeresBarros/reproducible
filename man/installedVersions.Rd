\usage{
installedVersions(pkgs, libPath)
}
\description{
This code is taken very directly from the \code{installed.versions} function in the
\code{versions} package, but uses an \code{Rcpp} alternative
to readLines for speed. It will be anywhere from 2x to 10x faster than the \code{installed.versions}
\code{versions} function. This is also many times faster (1000x ? for the 1 package
case) than \code{utils::installed.packages}
especially if only a subset of "all" packages in libPath are desired.
